    <p>
        My name is Jeremy and I was born in Canada. I suspect that I <em>may</em> have <strong>minor ADHD</strong> 
        but I haven't been to the doctor's to check. It could also just be a lack of self-discipline but I would
        like to think otherwise. Another theory I have is a short attention span due to growing up in the age of the internet.
        These could all just be excuses but I really should go to the doctor's whenever I can.
